Sifttter Redux
==============

Siftter Redux is a modification of Craig Eley's [Siftter](http://gist.github.com/craigeley/8301817 "Siftter"), a script to collect information from [IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com "IFTTT") and place it in a [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com, "Day One") journal. 

Siftter Redux's primary difference is in its execution method: it intended to run autonomously so that it does not need to be manually activated. This allows IFTTT data to be synchronized to Day One on a schedule.

The aim of this project was to use a Raspberry Pi; as such, the instructions below are specifically catered to that platform. That said, it should be possible to install and configure on any *NIX platform.

## Prerequisites

There are three prerequisites needed to run Sifttter Redux:

* Ruby (version 1.9.3 or greater)
* Git
* UUID

These packages must be installed on your system before running Sifttter Redux. To install these packages on Raspbian:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ruby
$ sudo apt-get install git-core
$ sudo apt-get install uuid
```

## Installation

First, clone this repository via git:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bachya/Sifttter-Redux.git
```

Next, cd into the Sifttter Redux directory and install the necessary gems:

```
$ cd Sifttter-Redux
$ bundle install
```

*(note that you may want to run `bundle install --global` for the sake of `cron` -- [see below](#cron-job))*

Finally, make sure the script is executable and initialize it:

```
$ chmod +x srd
$ ./srd init
```

## Usage

Syntax and usage can be accessed by running `./srd help`:

```
$ ./srd help
NAME
    srd - Sifttter Redux v1.1

    A modification of Craig Eley's Sifttter that allows for smart
    installation on a standalone *NIX device (such as a Raspberry Pi).

SYNOPSIS
    srd [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --help - Show this message

COMMANDS
    exec - Execute the script
    help - Shows a list of commands or help for one command
    init - Install and initialize dependencies
```

### Initialization

```
$ ./srd init
```

Initialization will perform the following steps:

1. Download [Dropbox-Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader "Dropbox-Uploder") to a location of your choice.
2. Collect some user preferences:
 1. The location on your filesystem where Sifttter files will be temporarily stored
 2. The location of your Sifttter files in Dropbox
 3. The location on your filesystem where Day One files will be temporarily stored
 4. The location of your Day One files in Dropbox
 
### Basic Mode

```
# Creates an entry for today 
$ ./srd exec
```

### "Catch-up" Mode

Sometimes, events occur that prevent Sifttter Redux from running (power loss to your device, a bad Cron job, etc.). In this case, Sifttter Redux's "catch-up" mode can be used to collect any valid journal data before the current day.

There are many ways to use this mode:

#### 7-Day Catch-up

To create entries for the past 7 days (not inclusive of the current day):

```
# Creates an entry for each day from from 7 days ago to yesterday
$ ./srd exec -c
```

To include the current day:

```
# Creates an entry for each day from 7 days ago to today
$ ./srd exec -c -i
```

#### Yesterday Catch-up

To create an entry for yesterday:

```
# Creates an entry for yesterday
$ ./srd exec -y
```

#### Date Range Catch-up

To create entries for a range of dates:

```
# Creates an entry for each day from 2/1/2014 to 2/12/2014
$ ./srd exec -f 2014-02-01 -to 2014-02-12
```

Even more simply, to create entries from a specific point until yesterday ("yesterday" because you might not be ready to have today's entries scanned):

```
# Creates an entry for each day from 2/1/2014 to yesterday's date
$ ./srd exec -f 2014-02-01
```

Of course, if you want to include today's date, you can always use the trusty `-i` switch:

```
# Creates an entry for each day from 2/1/2014 to today's date
$ ./srd exec -f 2014-02-01 -i
```

Two notes to be aware of:

* `-f` and `-t` are *inclusive* parameters, meaning that those dates will be included when searching for Siftter data.
* Although you can specify `-f` by itself, you cannot specify `-t` by itself.

Sifttter Redux makes use of the excellent [Chronic gem](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic "Chronic"), which provides natural language parsing for dates and times. This means that you can run commands with more "human" dates:

```
# Natural language parsing is great! Thanks, Chronic!
$ ./srd exec -f "last Thursday" -t "yesterday"
```

See [Chronic's Examples section](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic#examples "Chronic Examples") for more examples.

## Cron Job

By installing an entry to the Raspberry Pi's `crontab`, Sifttter Redux can be run automatically on a schedule.

One issue that arises is the loading of the bundled gems; because `cron` runs in a limited environment, it does not automatically know where to find installed gems.

### Using RVM

If your Raspberry Pi uses RVM, this `crontab` entry will do:

```
55 23 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" && "$HOME/Sifttter-Redux/srd" exec'
```

### Globally Installing Bundled Gems

Another option is to install the bundled gems to the global gemset:

```
bundle install --global
```

## Known Issues

* Sifttter Redux makes no effort to see if entries already exist in Day One for a particular date. This means that if you're not careful, you might end up with duplicate entries. A future version will address this.

## Future Releases

Some functionality I would like to tackle for future releases:

* Checking for existing Day One entries on a particular date
* Interactive cron job installer
* Verbose mode
* Automatic gem bundling
