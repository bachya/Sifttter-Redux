Sifttter Redux
==============

Siftter Redux is a modification of Craig Eley's [Siftter](http://gist.github.com/craigeley/8301817 "Siftter"), a script to collect information from [IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com "IFTTT") and place it in a [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com, "Day One") journal. 

Siftter Redux's primary difference is in its execution method: it intended to run autonomously so that it does not need to be manually activated. This allows IFTTT data to be synchronized to Day One on a schedule.

The aim of this project was to use a Raspberry Pi; as such, the instructions below are specifically catered to that platform. That said, it should be possible to install and configure on any *NIX platform.

## Prerequisites

In addition to Git (which, given you being on this site, I'll assume you have), there are two prerequisites needed to run Sifttter Redux in a *NIX environment:

* Ruby (version 1.9.3 or greater)
* UUID (required on the Raspberry Pi because it doesn't come with a function to do this by default)

To install on a Debian-esque system:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ruby
$ sudo apt-get install uuid
```

## Installation

```
gem install sifttter-redux
```

## Usage

Syntax and usage can be accessed by running `srd help`:

```
$ srd help
NAME
    srd - Sifttter Redux

    A modification of Craig Eley's Sifttter that allows for smart
    installation on a standalone *NIX device (such as a Raspberry Pi).

SYNOPSIS
    srd [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION
    0.2.1

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --help    - Show this message
    --version - Display the program version

COMMANDS
    exec - Execute the script
    help - Shows a list of commands or help for one command
    init - Install and initialize dependencies
```

### Initialization

```
$ srd init
```

Initialization will perform the following steps:

1. Download [Dropbox-Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader "Dropbox-Uploder") to a location of your choice.
2. Collect some user preferences:
 1. The location on your filesystem where Sifttter files will be temporarily stored
 2. The location of your Sifttter files in Dropbox
 3. The location on your filesystem where Day One files will be temporarily stored
 4. The location of your Day One files in Dropbox
 
### Basic Mode

```
# Creates an entry for today 
$ srd exec
```

### "Catch-up" Mode

Sometimes, events occur that prevent Sifttter Redux from running (power loss to your device, a bad Cron job, etc.). In this case, Sifttter Redux's "catch-up" mode can be used to collect any valid journal data before the current day.

There are many ways to use this mode:

#### 7-Day Catch-up

To create entries for the past 7 days (not inclusive of the current day):

```
# Creates an entry for each day from from 7 days ago to yesterday
$ srd exec -c
```

To include the current day:

```
# Creates an entry for each day from 7 days ago to today
$ srd exec -c -i
```

#### Yesterday Catch-up

To create an entry for yesterday:

```
# Creates an entry for yesterday
$ srd exec -y
```

#### Date Range Catch-up

To create entries for a range of dates:

```
# Creates an entry for each day from 2/1/2014 to 2/12/2014
$ srd exec -f 2014-02-01 -t 2014-02-12
```

Even more simply, to create entries from a specific point until yesterday ("yesterday" because you might not be ready to have today's entries scanned):

```
# Creates an entry for each day from 2/1/2014 to yesterday's date
$ srd exec -f 2014-02-01
```

Of course, if you want to include today's date, you can always use the trusty `-i` switch:

```
# Creates an entry for each day from 2/1/2014 to today's date
$ srd exec -f 2014-02-01 -i
```

Two notes to be aware of:

* `-f` and `-t` are *inclusive* parameters, meaning that when specified, those dates will be included when searching for Siftter data.
* Although you can specify `-f` by itself, you cannot specify `-t` by itself.

Sifttter Redux makes use of the excellent [Chronic gem](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic "Chronic"), which provides natural language parsing for dates and times. This means that you can run commands with more "human" dates:

```
# Natural language parsing is great! Thanks, Chronic!
$ srd exec -f "last Thursday" -t "yesterday"
```

See [Chronic's Examples section](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic#examples "Chronic Examples") for more examples.

## Cron Job

By installing an entry to the Raspberry Pi's `crontab`, Sifttter Redux can be run automatically on a schedule.

One issue that arises is the loading of the bundled gems; because `cron` runs in a limited environment, it does not automatically know where to find installed gems.

### Using RVM

If your Raspberry Pi uses RVM, this `crontab` entry will do:

```
55 23 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" && srd exec'
```

### Globally Installing Bundled Gems

Another option is to install the bundled gems to the global gemset:

```
$ bundle install --global
```

## Known Issues

* Sifttter Redux makes no effort to see if entries already exist in Day One for a particular date. This means that if you're not careful, you might end up with duplicate entries. A future version will address this.
* At indeterminiate times (usually when in catch-up mode), Sifttter Redux will upload a file to Day One that Day One fails to read. Uncertain of the cause at this stage, but it's happened a few times.

## Future Releases

Some functionality I would like to tackle for future releases:

* Interactive cron job installer
* Verbose mode that more explicity tells the user what's currently going on
* Smarter checking of the config file to see if an old version is being used
