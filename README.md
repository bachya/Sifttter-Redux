Sifttter Redux
==============

Siftter Redux is a modification of Craig Eley's [Siftter](http://gist.github.com/craigeley/8301817 "Siftter"), a script to collect information from [IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com "IFTTT") and place it in a [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com, "Day One") journal. 

Siftter Redux's primary difference is in its execution method: it intended to run autonomously so that it does not need to be manually activated. This allows IFTTT data to be synchronized to Day One on a schedule.

The aim of this project was to use a Raspberry Pi; as such, the instructions below are specifically catered to that platform. That said, it should be possible to install and configure on any *NIX platform.

## Prerequisites

There are three prerequisites needed to run Sifttter Redux:

* Ruby (version 1.9.3 or greater)
* Git
* UUID

These packages must be installed on your system before running Sifttter Redux. To install these packages on Raspbian:

```
sudo apt-get install ruby
sudo apt-get install git-core
sudo apt-get install uuid
```

## Installation

First, clone this repository via git:

```
git clone https://github.com/bachya/Sifttter-Redux.git
```

Next, cd into the Sifttter Redux directory and install the necessary gems:

```
cd Sifttter-Redux
bundle install
```

*(note that you may want to run `bundle install --global` for the sake of `cron` -- [see below](#cron-job))*

Finally, make sure the script is executable and initialize it:

```
chmod +x srd
./srd init
```

## Usage

Syntax and usage can be accessed by running `./srd help`:

```
NAME
    srd - Sifttter Redux v1.1

    A modification of Craig Eley's Sifttter that allows for smart
    installation on a standalone *NIX device (such as a Raspberry Pi).

SYNOPSIS
    srd [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --help - Show this message

COMMANDS
    exec - Execute the script
    help - Shows a list of commands or help for one command
    init - Install and initialize dependencies
```

## "Catch-up" Mode

Sometimes, events occur that prevent Sifttter Redux from running (power loss to your device, a bad Cron job, etc.). In this case, Sifttter Redux's "catch-up" mode can be used to collect any valid journal data between a range of dates.

To use this mode, simply specify `--from` and `--to` parameters when executing the script:

```
# Looks for entries from 2/1/2014 to 2/12/2014
./srd exec --from=2014-02-01 --to=2014-02-12
```

Even more simply, to create entries from a specific point until yesterday ("yesterday" because you might not be ready to have today's entries scanned):

```
# Looks for entries from 2/1/2014 to yesterday's date
./srd exec --from=2014-02-01
```

Two notes to be aware of:

* `--from` and `--to` are *inclusive* parameters, meaning that those dates will be included when searching for Siftter data.
* Although you can specify `--from` by itself, you cannot specify `--to` by itself.

Sifttter Redux makes use of the excellent [Chronic gem](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic "Chronic"), which provides natural language parsing for dates and times. This means that you can run commands with more "human" dates:

```
./srd exec --from="last Thursday" --to="yesterday"
```

See [Chronic's Examples section](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic#examples "Chronic Examples") for more examples.

## Cron Job

By installing an entry to the Raspberry Pi's `crontab`, Sifttter Redux can be run automatically on a schedule.

One issue that arises is the loading of the bundled gems; because `cron` runs in a limited environment, it does not automatically know where to find installed gems.

### Using RVM

If your Raspberry Pi uses RVM, this `crontab` entry will do:

```
55 23 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" && "$HOME/Sifttter-Redux/srd" exec'
```

### Globally Installing Bundled Gems

Another option is to install the bundled gems to the global gemset:

```
bundle install --global
```

## Known Issues

None at the moment.

## Future Releases

Some functionality I would like to tackle for future releases:

* Interactive cron job installer
* Verbose mode
* Automatic gem bundling
