Sifttter Redux
==============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bachya/Sifttter-Redux.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bachya/Sifttter-Redux)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sifttter-redux.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/sifttter-redux)

Siftter Redux is a modification of Craig Eley's [Sifttter](http://craigeley.com/post/72565974459/sifttter-an-ifttt-to-day-one-logger "Sifttter"), a script to collect information from [IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com "IFTTT") and place it in a [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com, "Day One") journal.

Siftter Redux has several fundamental differences:

* Interactive logging of today's events or events in the past
* "Catch Up" mode for logging several days' events at once
* Packaged as a command line app, complete with documentation and help
* Easy installation on cron for automated running

# Prerequisites

In addition to Git (which, given you being on this site, I'll assume you have), Ruby (v. 1.9.3 or greater) is needed.

# Installation

```
gem install sifttter-redux
```

# Usage

Syntax and usage can be accessed by running `srd help`:

```
$ srd help
NAME
    srd - Sifttter Redux

    A customized IFTTT-to-Day One service that allows for
    smart installation and automated running on a standalone
    *NIX device (such as a Raspberry Pi).

SYNOPSIS
    srd [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION
    0.6.2

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --help         - Show this message
    --[no-]verbose - Turns on verbose output
    --version      - Display the program version

COMMANDS
    exec - Execute the script
    help - Shows a list of commands or help for one command
    init - Install and initialize dependencies
```

Note that each command's options can be revealed by adding the `--help` switch after the command. For example:

```
$ srd exec --help
NAME
    exec - Execute the script

SYNOPSIS
    srd [global options] exec [command options]

COMMAND OPTIONS
    -c             - Run catch-up mode from the beginning of the week to yesterday
    -f arg         - Run catch-up mode with this start date (default: none)
    -i             - Include today's date in catch-up
    -n arg         - Run catch-up mode for the last N days (default: none)
    -t arg         - Run catch-up mode with this end date (must also have -f) (default: none)
    --[no-]verbose - Turns on verbose output
    -w arg         - Run catch-up mode for the last N weeks (default: none)
    -y             - Run catch-up mode for yesterday
```

## Initialization

```
$ srd init
```

Initialization will perform the following steps:

1. Download [Dropbox Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader "Dropbox-Uploder") to a location of your choice.
2. Automatically configure Dropbox Uploader.
3. Collect some user paths (note that you can use tab completion here!):
 * The location on your filesystem where Sifttter files will be temporarily stored
 * The location of your Sifttter files in Dropbox
 * The location on your filesystem where Day One files will be temporarily stored
 * The location of your Day One files in Dropbox

## Pathing

Note that when Sifttter Redux asks you for paths, it will ask for "local" and "remote" filepaths. It's important to understand the difference.

### Local Filepaths

Local filepaths are, as you'd expect, filepaths on your local machine. Some examples might be:

* `/tmp/my_data`
* `/home/bob/ifttt/sifttter_data`
* `~/sifttter`

### Remote Filepaths

Remote filepaths, on the other hand, are absolute filepaths in your Dropbox folder (*as Dropbox Uploader would see them*). For instance, `/home/bob/Dropbox/apps/sifttter` is *not* a valid remote filepath; rather, `/apps/sifttter` would be correct.

## Basic Execution

```
$ srd exec
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entry for February 15, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 15, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

## "Catch-up" Mode

Sometimes, events occur that prevent Sifttter Redux from running (power loss to your device, a bad Cron job, etc.). In this case, Sifttter Redux's "catch-up" mode can be used to collect any valid journal on or before today's date.

There are many ways to use this mode (note that "today" in these examples is **February 15, 2014**):

### Yesterday Catch-up

To create an entry for yesterday:

```
$ srd exec -y
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entry for February 14, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 14, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

### Last "N" Days Catch-up

Sifttter Redux allows you to specify the number of days back it should look for new entries:

```
$ srd exec -n 3
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entries for dates from February 12, 2014 to February 14, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 12, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 13, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 14, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!

$ srd exec -n 12
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entries for dates from February 03, 2014 to February 14, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: February 03, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 04, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 05, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 06, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 07, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 08, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 09, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 10, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 11, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 12, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 13, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: February 14, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

Note that this option goes until yesterday ("yesterday" because you might not be ready to have today's entries scanned). If you'd rather include today's date, you can always add the `-i` switch:

```
$ srd exec -i -n 3
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entries for dates from February 12, 2014 to February 15, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 12, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 13, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 14, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 15, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

### Last "N" Weeks Catch-up

Sifttter Redux also allows you to specify a number of weeks back that should be scanned for new entries:

```
$ srd exec -w 1
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entries for dates from February 03, 2014 to February 14, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.

---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

As you'd expect, you can always add the `-i` switch:

```
$ srd exec -i -w 1
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entries for dates from February 03, 2014 to February 15, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 03, 2014...

---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 05, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 06, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 07, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 08, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 09, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 10, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 11, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 12, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 13, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 14, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 15, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

### Date Range Catch-up

To create entries for a range of dates:

```
$ srd exec -f 2014-02-01 -t 2014-02-12
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entries for dates from February 01, 2014 to February 12, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 01, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 02, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 03, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 04, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 05, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 06, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 07, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 08, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 09, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 10, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 11, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 12, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

Even more simply, to create entries from a specific point until yesterday ("yesterday" because you might not be ready to have today's entries scanned):

```
$ srd exec -f 2014-02-01
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entries for dates from February 01, 2014 to February 12, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 01, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 02, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 03, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 04, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 05, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 06, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 07, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 08, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 09, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 10, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 11, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 12, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

In this case, once more, you can use the trusty `-i` switch if you want:

```
$ srd exec -i -f 2014-02-01
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entries for dates from February 01, 2014 to February 15, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 01, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 02, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 03, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 04, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 05, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 06, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 07, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 08, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 09, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 10, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 11, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 12, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 13, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 14, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 15, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

Two notes to be aware of:

* `-f` and `-t` are *inclusive* parameters, meaning that when specified, those dates will be included when searching for Siftter data.
* Although you can specify `-f` by itself, you cannot specify `-t` by itself.

Sifttter Redux makes use of the excellent [Chronic gem](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic "Chronic"), which provides natural language parsing for dates and times. This means that you can run commands with more "human" dates:

```
$ srd exec -f "last monday" -t "yesterday"
#### EXECUTING...
---> INFO: Creating entries for dates from February 10, 2014 to February 14, 2014...
---> INFO: Downloading Sifttter files...DONE.
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 10, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 11, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 12, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 13, 2014...
---> SUCCESS: Entry logged for February 14, 2014...
---> INFO: Uploading Day One entries to Dropbox...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Day One files...DONE.
---> INFO: Removing downloaded Sifttter files...DONE.
#### EXECUTION COMPLETE!
```

See [Chronic's Examples section](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic#examples "Chronic Examples") for more examples.

# Cron Job

By installing an entry to a `crontab`, Sifttter Redux can be run automatically on a schedule. The aim of this project was to use a Raspberry Pi; as such, the instructions below are specifically catered to that platform. That said, it should be possible to install and configure on any *NIX platform.

One issue that arises is the loading of the bundled gems; because cron runs in a limited environment, it does not automatically know where to find installed gems.

## Using RVM

If your Raspberry Pi uses RVM, this `crontab` entry will do:

```
55 23 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" && srd exec'
```

## Globally Installing Bundled Gems

Another option is to install the bundled gems to the global gemset:

```
$ bundle install --global
```

# Logging

Sifttter Redux logs a lot of good info to `~/.sifttter_redux_log`. It makes use of Ruby's standard log levels:

* DEBUG
* INFO
* WARN
* ERROR
* FATAL
* UNKNOWN

If you want to see more or less in your log files, simply change the `log_level` value in `~/.sifttter_redux` to your desired level.
